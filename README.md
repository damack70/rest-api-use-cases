## Organization

Examples are segmented by scripting language. The goal is to have all use cases represented in each language. Note, if you create the use case in Postman, you can easily convert to other languages using the 'Code' option. 

Each language directory contains a project template you may use to create your own examples.

Each language directory also contains an authentication folder. Use the code provided for your examples. Please note, we're using password authentication grant_type, which is the easiest, but least secure method. 

## Contributing

We welcome your contributions! This project only gets better with examples from others. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit contributions to this project. 

While not required, we encourage you to contribute your code in multiple scripting languages. If you need assistance with this, please open an issue and we'll provide assistance.
