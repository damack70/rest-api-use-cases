# Text Analytics Scoring

## Overview

This app leverages our SAS Viya and CAS APIs. It is a good way to demonstrate how one can operationalize text models (not only ML ones). In this example, we apply three Text Analytics Models through REST requests.

The [sentiment analysis example](sentiment/README.md) is self-contained and requires no additional setup outside of the REST calls. To complete the [concepts and categories](concepts-categories/README.md) use cases, you must first deploy a text analytics model in SAS. Details for running each use case are found in the individual projects.
